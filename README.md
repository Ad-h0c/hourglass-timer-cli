## Installation

### Cloning the Repository

1. First, clone the repository to your local machine using git:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/hourglass-timer-cli.git
```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

```sh
cd hourglass-timer-cli
```

### Installing Dependencies

3. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
4. Install the dependencies by running:

```sh
npm install
```

This command installs all the necessary dependencies from the `package.json` file.

### Making Hourglass Globally Available

#### Windows

For Windows, you can make the `hourglass` command globally available by adding it to your systemâ€™s PATH variable. You can do this by navigating to your npm installation folder and adding it to the PATH.

1. Find where your global npm packages are stored by running:

```sh
npm bin -g
```

2. Add the directory to your system's PATH environment variable.

#### MacOS and Linux

For MacOS and Linux, linking the package globally will make the command available system-wide.

```sh
npm link
```

This installs `hourglass` globally and you can now access it from anywhere in the command line.

```sh
./hourglass.js [options]
